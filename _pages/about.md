👋 Hi! My name is __Nathan__.

# 🌏 What I'm doing now

I currently live near __Seoul, South Korea__ and I'm now serving my military duty for my country until July 2022.

# 👨‍💻 What I (used to) do

I've built multiple mobile apps and web services so far, and I'm exploring the broader world of computer science now.

# 🚀 What inspires me

I inspire to utilitize the power of computer to improve everyone's life! I wonder and imagine how far we, as humans, will be in 10 years.

# ✨ Other things I'm interested in

And also, I love videography and photography! Capturing beautiful moments and telling interesting stories always excites me. 🎥📸
