ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is Nathan.

I currently live near __Seoul, South Korea__ and I'm now serving my military duty for my country until July 2022.

I've built multiple Android apps and web services so far, and I'm exploring the broader world of computer science now. ðŸš€

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/ntcho), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/nt.cho) and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/nathancho). Also I have [berict.com](https://berict.com) as my personal website, and you can see more of my work and experiences there.
