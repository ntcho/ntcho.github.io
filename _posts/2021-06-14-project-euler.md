How do you improve your mathmatical problem solving skills?

# ðŸ¤” Why Project Euler?

Recently, I felt the need to improve my problem solving skills in programming.

__LeetCode__, __HackerRank__, __Project Euler__ seemed like popular websites for coding problems. After trying each of them out, I settled down to use HackerRank and Project Euler.

For me, HackerRank was better than LeetCode. It didn't ask me to pay every page, and it had a better coding environment as they provide the starting codes.

## ðŸ™‹ Why Project Euler with Hackerrank?

While HackerRank focuses on Computer Science concepts such as data structures and algorithms, Project Euler focuses on pure mathematics. Problems from Project Euler made me use pure mathematical properties before using any other type of data structures or computing tricks. 

I found it helpful because in CS, we always work with some sort of data - which can be represented in a mathematical way - so using mathematical properties in actual codes can greatly improve the performance.

## ðŸ˜‘ TL;DR

__HackerRank__ for coding problems, __Project Euler__ for mathematical problems. 

I solve my Project Euler problems on [my blog](https://ntcho.github.io/project_euler)! (Please check it out and leave your thoughts on the comments ðŸ™‚)

### âœ¨ Bonus: My problem solving workflow

In case you wonder how I solve Project Euler problems:

1. Solve the problem with Python.
2. Look for ideas or better solutons on the problem thread.
3. Organize it into a Jupyter notebook on [my GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ntcho/project_euler).
4. Publish the notebook automatically to [my blog](https://ntcho.github.io/project_euler) with [`fastpages`](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages).
