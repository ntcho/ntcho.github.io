Is mathmatical problem solving important for Computer Science?

# Why Project Euler?

looking for websites to improve my problem solving skills

found leetcode, hackerrank, project euler, ...

settled down to hackerrank and project euler

## What is Hackerrank?

short explanation

## What is Project Euler?

short explanation

# Why Project Euler with Hackerrank?

closer to pure mathematics, actually using mathematical properties as a shortcut to the problem

since CS handles data, which can be represented in a mathematical way - math is also important for CS

# My workflow

solve (with Python)

look for better solutons

organize it into Jupyter notebook on GitHub
